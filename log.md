# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 04, 2021 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Built a game called Madlibs in Python

**Thoughts:** Today I started 100 days of Code challenge to keep myself consistent with learning something new everyday. So today I have built a game called Madlibs. This is a very basic python programmed game where you give some inputs and it gets substituted in a paragraph. In this I have done usage of f-string in python.

**Today's Progress**: Built a game called Computer Guess My Number in Python

**Thoughts:** Today I have built a game called Computer Guess My Number. In this game user can give a hint to computer specifying minimum and maximum range of numbers and computer has to correctly guess the number that you have thought of. In this I have done usage of library called **random** in python.
