# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 04, 2021 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Built a game called Madlibs in Python

**Thoughts:** Today I started 100 days of Code challenge to keep myself consistent with learning something new everyday. So today I have built a game called Madlibs. This is a very basic python programmed game where you give some inputs and it gets substituted in a paragraph. In this I have done usage of f-string in python.

### Day 2: July 05, 2021 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Built a game called Computer Guess My Number in Python

**Thoughts:** Today I have built a game called Computer Guess My Number. In this game user can give a hint to computer specifying minimum and maximum range of numbers and computer has to correctly guess the number that you have thought of. In this I have done usage of library called **random** in python and algorithm is based on Binary searching algorithm which has a time complexity of O(log n).

### Day 3: July 06, 2021 (Example 3)

**Today's Progress**: Built a game called Rock Paper Scissors in Python

**Thoughts:** Built a game called Rock Paper Scissors. In this game user can provide his/her choice amongst rock, paper and scissor and based on computer's choice, either user or computer will be a winner. In this I have done usage of library called **random** in python.

### Day 4: July 07, 2021 (Example 4)

**Today's Progress**: Usage of Decorators in Python

**Thoughts:** Defined a custom decorator to wrap a function. Decorators are very powerful and useful design pattern in python which modifies the behaviour of function or class.

### Day 5: July 08, 2021 (Example 5)

**Today's Progress**: Usage of Property in Python

**Thoughts:** Defined a class which demonstrates usage of property decorator in python. In Python, property() is a built-in function that creates and returns a property object.

### Day 6: July 09, 2021 (Example 6)

**Today's Progress**: Usage of Callable in Python

**Thoughts:** Defined a class which demonstrates usage of callable in python. This built-in method in Python checks and returns True if the object passed appears to be callable, but may not be, otherwise False.
